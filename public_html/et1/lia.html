    <h3>Our LIA Brainstorm...</h3>


   <h1>Plan</h1> 
   <h2> - Massimo and I are planning to use Blender and Fusion. Since we are both very big soccer fans, we decided it would be a great idea to do something that involves soccer</h2>
<h2> - We would like to design soccer characters (aka players), in a soccer stadium with fans, and referees, as well as advertising boards, and the team's logo. </h2>
<h1>Plot</h1>
<h2> -  Starts off with the players in a stadium in a single file line (two teams' side by side). Establishing Shot </h2>
<h2> - Truck -> Camera follows the players as their national anthem is sung, as they anxiously wait for the biggest game of the season to start.</h2>
<h2> - Ref blows his whistle for kickoff and the game is underway. Player 1 on team 1 passes the ball to player 2. He shoots, and team 2's goalie makes a great save. Team 2 gets a chance, and scores! Team 2 leads 1-0 at the 35th minute. Team 2 gets another great chance, but Team 1's goalie makes a great save! Team 1 gets a great chance and scores! He goes to celebrate with his team, 65th minute. </h2>
<h2> - It's very tense and the two teams are battling it out for the win </h2>
<h2> - 95th minute, team 2 player trips team 1 player. The referee blows his whistle and points to the penalty spot. Team 1 players step up nervously. And takes it and scores! He goes to celebrate as the referee blows full time! Team 1 wins 2-1! Home fans are happy! Away fan is not. </h2>
